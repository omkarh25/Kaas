**File and Folder Naming Guidelines for Serendipity**

> **Note:** These guidelines are here to make our digital lives easier. Think of them as a friendly reminder that order can bring us peace (and fewer frantic searches).

**Introduction: The Saga of the Misplaced Files**

Once upon a time, in the bustling offices of Serendipity, there was chaos. No, not the fun, lively kind of chaos where everyone is buzzing with creativity. This was the dreaded "I-can't-find-that-important-file-from-yesterday" kind of chaos. Picture Jeff from accounting frantically searching for a report named "final_FINAL_v3_REALLYFINAL.xlsx" and the tech team struggling with folders named "new folder (3)". It was a nightmare that left everyone wondering why they couldn't just name things in a way that made sense.

But fear not, brave Serendipity employees! We present to you the File and Folder Naming Guidelines—crafted with love, logic, and a pinch of humor to save us all from the labyrinth of poorly named files. Trust us, your future self (and your teammates) will thank you.

**1. General Guidelines: Saving Sanity, One File at a Time**

> **Reminder:** Consistency is what separates us from madness.

- **Be Descriptive**: Imagine finding a file named "doc1" versus one named "client_proposal_2024_Q1". The latter saves you from wanting to pull your hair out. Use clear, descriptive names that tell everyone exactly what’s inside.
  - **Tip:** Think about what would help you find this file a year from now.
- **Avoid Special Characters**: We know, we know—special characters are cool. But they can also make our lives complicated when certain systems don't play nice with them. So, keep it simple: use hyphens (-) or underscores (_) instead of spaces or special characters.
  - **Why?** Special characters can cause compatibility issues in different systems.
- **Consistency is Key**: Consistency is what separates us from madness. Follow a uniform structure across all departments to keep our digital shelves neat and tidy.
  - **Example:** Always use lowercase letters and a consistent date format.
- **Versioning Matters**: Ever seen five files all named "final"? We have. And it's terrifying. Include versioning (v1, v2, etc.) to indicate progress. Remember, "final" is a trap—files can always evolve!
  - **Pro Tip:** Avoid using "final" unless it's truly the last version (and even then, think twice).
- **All Lowercase Letters**: Nobody wants to debate over "Report" vs "report". Use lowercase letters for uniformity and fewer arguments at the coffee machine.

**2. Department-Specific Prefixes: Who's Who?**

> **Purpose:** Department prefixes help identify the file's origin at a glance.

To help everyone know where files belong without having to open them:
- **TRD-** for Trademan (Tech Department): Because tech files should come with a built-in compass.
- **SER-** for Serendipity (Accounting Department): So we don't confuse invoices with server logs.
- **DMF-** for Dumfridus (Marketing Department): Because marketing deserves its own flair.

**3. File Naming Format: The Golden Recipe**

> **Format:** `[Department Prefix]_[Project/Client]_[Type/Subject]_[Date/Version]`

- **Examples:**
  - **TRD_ProjectA_report_v1**: Tech team, please name that report like you’ll need it a year from now. (Spoiler: you will!)
  - **SER_ClientX_invoice_2024-09-15**: No more scrambling at tax time, we promise.
  - **DMF_CampaignB_strategy_v2**: When "strategy" needs another round of "strategizing".

**4. Folder Naming Format: Organized and Satisfied**

> **Format:** `[Department Prefix]_[Project/Client]_[Year]`

- **Examples:**
  - **TRD_WebsiteUpgrade_2024**: Future-proof your folder by adding the year. Future you will thank you.
  - **SER_QuarterlyStatements_2024**: Because past statements should stay in the past, neatly filed.
  - **DMF_ProductLaunch_2024**: Marketing magic stays magical when it’s easy to find.

**5. Specific Guidelines by Department: Because One Size Doesn't Fit All**

**Trademan (Tech Department) - TRD**
- **Code Files**: Code can be beautiful… if it’s organized. Name code files with the project name and module or feature. Example: **TRD_DinAPI_authentication_v1**. No more hunting for that elusive script.
  - **Hint:** Include specific features or functions in the name.
- **Documentation**: Suffix your documentation with "docs" to make it obvious. Example: **TRD_MobileApp_docs_v1**. Trust us, you’ll want to know what’s code and what’s a manual.

**Serendipity (Accounting Department) - SER**
- **Invoices**: Client name and date are your best friends here. Example: **SER_ClientY_invoice_2024-10-15**. Keep it classy and easy to track.
  - **Tip:** Including the date helps when searching for past invoices.
- **Reports**: Whether it’s annual, quarterly, or ad hoc, make it specific. Example: **SER_AnnualReport_2023-2024**. Future auditors will adore you.

**Dumfridus (Marketing Department) - DMF**
- **Campaigns**: Campaign name and content type are the dynamic duo. Example: **DMF_WinterPromo_social_v3**. Because campaigns evolve faster than coffee trends.
- **Creative Assets**: Specify asset type (graphic, video, etc.). Example: **DMF_SummerSale_graphic_v2**. No more "is this the final video version?" questions.

**6. Date Format: For When You Want to Travel Back in Time**

> **Format:** Use **YYYY-MM-DD**.

- It’s logical, sortable, and makes you look like you know what you’re doing. **2024-10-15** reads better than "15th Oct final no-really-final".

**7. Version Control: Defeating the FINAL_final_v3 Curse**

> **Tip:** Add "v1", "v2", etc., to indicate versions.

- We’ve all been victims of the "final" misnomer. Spoiler: nothing is ever truly final. Use "final" sparingly and preferably only once. Example: **DMF_BrandingGuide_final** (for real).

**8. Archives and Obsolete Files: The Digital Attic**

> **Action:** Move outdated files to an "Archive" folder.

- Prefix with "ARCHIVE_" so they don’t haunt you during searches. Example: **ARCHIVE_TRD_ProjectX_docs_v1**. Because ghosts belong in the attic, not in our working folders.

**9. Examples Overview: A Quick Recap**

> **Folders:**
- **TRD_CloudMigration_2024**
- **SER_TaxFilings_2023**
- **DMF_NewProductLaunch_2024**

> **Files:**
- **TRD_APIIntegration_docs_v2**
- **SER_ClientX_payment_2024-08-20**
- **DMF_AdCampaignB_video_v1**

**Final Words: A Toast to Organized Files**

> **Motivation:** Following these guidelines isn’t just about saving time—it’s about saving our collective sanity.

The next time you’re looking for that one file, you’ll thank past-you for being organized. And remember: friends don’t let friends name things "new folder (2)". Cheers to happy, organized, stress-free file searching!
