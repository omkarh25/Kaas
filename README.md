# Meeting Transcriber and Transcript Search Application

This is a PyQt6-based desktop application that allows users to upload audio files, transcribe them, and search for the resulting transcript using a `file_search_dir`. The application has two primary functionalities:
1. Upload an audio file for transcription.
2. Automatically or manually search for the transcript based on the `file_search_dir` provided after transcription.

## Features

- **Audio Upload and Transcription**: Upload an audio file and submit it for transcription.
- **Search Transcript**: Once the transcription is completed, you can search and retrieve the transcript using a `file_search_dir`.
- **Automatic Tab Switch**: After transcription, the application switches to the search tab and populates the `file_search_dir`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or above
- PyQt6
- Requests

### Explanation:
1. **Screenshots**: For the screenshots, you need to take snapshots of the app while using it. You can place the images inside a folder like `screenshots/` in the project directory.
2. **Screenshots Folder**: Create a folder named `screenshots` in the same directory where `README.md` is located. Place your screenshots there:
   - `upload-audio.png` (Screenshot of the audio upload step)
   - `transcription-in-progress.png` (Screenshot of the transcription process)
   - `search-transcript.png` (Screenshot of the search transcript tab)

### How to Add Screenshots:
- Take screenshots of the app (while uploading audio, transcription, and searching).
- Place those images inside a folder named `screenshots/` in your project directory.
- Reference those images in your `README.md` using relative paths like this:
